docker run -d -p 80:80 -p 443:443 nginx_image

docker image ls -q
to list all images but show only id


first configure nginx. install it, install ssl, expose ports, remove default config in sites available, copy a config for wordpress in conf.d
There is a volume, that is shared between nginx and wordpress containers, that will contain the files of wordpress that nginx has to serve

then configure mariadb. 

root /var/www/html;
/etc/nginx/

nginx conf : 
root vs alias : root append, alias not append

--password=$Password

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

3 containers :
    - mariadb : database for wordpress created, with a user created that has all privileges for that new db. +volume
    - wordpress : download and extract wordpress files, has php installed. volume shared with nginx
    - nginx : config file working for new wordpress website. volume that is shared with wordpress container


mariadb has a simple database, with a user for wordpress. Password is saved in env file somehow. Make it work first with plain password maybe

wordpress container has php installed, and has the files for the website

nginx is the last one to start. it depends on both mariadb and wordpress. See video in playlist to see syntax for depends, and restart


1/MARIADB: install mariadb, create user, create database, grant priv for that db to that user, flush, thats it
mariadb : volume, network, no port, depends on nothing, restart always

2/WORDPRESS: install php, download wordpress, copy config file with details from db
wordpress : volume, network, no port, depends on mariadb, restart always

3/NGINX: install nginx, [DO TLS STUFF], copy config file to make wordpress works (include the link to wordpress container for php), reload
nginx : volume, network, port bind, depends on wordpress and mariadb, restard always


NEED : make TLS work without warning. Need to create a CA and make it trusted by the VM ? Or something like that

QUESTION : why php is installed in wordpress container and not nginx container ?
